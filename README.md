# react-typescript-jbook

#### App Description
A Storybook / Codepen type app that allows the user to write code in the browser and see it in a preview window in real-time.
The user can import packages from npm just like Codepen. ESBuild will handle the importing of npm files and JavaScript code
and transpile/compile it down to be executed in the browser, all in real-time.
